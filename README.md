Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to search and filter animals by breed. It retrieves data from two APIs — the Cat API and the Dog API — and displays information about the animals, including their images and breeds. Users can filter by type (cat or dog), search by breed name, and paginate through the results.


Features
Search by breed: Users can search for animals based on breed names.
Filter by type: The application allows filtering between cats, dogs, or both.
Pagination: Displays 10 animals per page with options to navigate through pages.
Breed details: Displays animal information such as breed temperament when hovered over.
Responsive design: The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.



Technologies Used
React.js: The UI is built using the React library for modular and responsive components.
TypeScript: The application uses TypeScript for better type checking and enhanced code quality.
Flowbite: The UI components like buttons and loaders are styled with Flowbite.
TheCatAPI: Fetches data about different breeds of cats.
TheDogAPI: Fetches data about different breeds of dogs.
TailwindCSS: For custom styling and responsive design.
